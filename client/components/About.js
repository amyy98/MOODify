            <h2>☁ What is a Mood Tracker? ☁</h2>
            <p>Mood mapping is when you chart your moods for at least one month - identifying good, bad and indifferent moods. This mood tracker offers a range of 5 emotions (excited, happy, neutral, tired, sad). The simplest method for mood tracking is through a chart where you record your mood on a scale and optionally provide additional notes. You can then use this log to understand your mood changes over time, search for patterns, and implement changes to improve your mood. ☼</p>
